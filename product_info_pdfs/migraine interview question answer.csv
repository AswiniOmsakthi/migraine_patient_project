Question,Answer
"Happy Migraine Awareness Month to everybody.  We are finding out all about the unique journeys that we have with migraine because none of us really have the same experience, but some of us do well with some things and some of us do well with other things.  The one drug that I am of course most passionate about is Aim A Big.  I'm probably the most famous Aim, A big super responder in the country.  But here to help me talk about Aimovig is Suzanne, who was on Aimovig for a long time.  Thanks, Suzanne for joining us.",Thank you for asking me.
Very happy to have you here because you're actually one of the stories that I think people get value from and that is people who were on Aimovig did really well on Aimovig and have now tried one of the others. ,
"So firstly, tell us a bit about yourself.  Where do you live and what's your migraine like?","I live in Mildura, so I am very country, Victoria.  I am as far away from Melbourne as you could possibly be and yes, I'm in the corner of NSW, SA and Victoria on the Murray River."
"Now, if you do live in that area too, we do actually have a local support group there.  It's called the Sunrasia Migraine Warriors group.  Go look it up on Facebook.",
"All right, tell me about your migraine.","OK, I've had migraines since I was 12.  I'm in my mid 50s now.  So I have had them for a very long time and I had migraine 24/7.  So if I was lucky I would have a couple of hours off from having a migraine every month.  So I was had them all the time.  I was at the stage where I pretty much was getting asked all the time at work.  When was I looking at retiring.  I, yeah, could not function.  I come from a family of migraine sufferers from both sides of my family.  Both my mother and my paternal grandfather were migraine sufferers.  I have a sister that's a migraine sufferer as well.  So it's it, it's just there.  Two of my children also have my migraines as well."
"So how long?  Like how many years were you all day, every day?",Probably from my mid 20s onwards.
"So 20 plus years, yeah, that's a pretty long slog.",Yes
"So I'm proud of you for still being here, if I can say that as gently as I can, because one of the things that we are always concerned about as a community is that you get to a point where the relentlessness of it just gets too much.  So there is actually a day in Migraine Awareness Month, it's called Shine a Light Day on June 7, where we acknowledge people who have died because of migraine.  It's started by charity in the US.  It's never been done here, but we're going to include it in the schedule for this year anyway.  ",
Let's get back and talk about more positive things.  So I'm presuming you tried absolutely everything else before Aimovig.,"I did.  I'm actually very lucky that I have a very supportive GP.  He's his wife also suffered from migraines so it's his ex-wife now.  But every time that he came across something that was new he would trial it on both her and me at the same time.  We're actually really close friends.  We're actually in the same theatre group together and we've known each other since the mid 80s.  And yeah, so he would, as soon as he found out on something about something that he could prescribe, he would try on both of us to see if it worked.  And then if it didn't work, he'd go, okay, now I've got to find something else.  So he would, we went, we did eye drops, we did anything that he could possibly think of.  He would try it on me to see if it would work.  Sometimes it would work on, it would work for a short time and then it wouldn't work anymore and he'd be getting really frustrated with the fact that that it wouldn't work.  So I'm very lucky that way that he would try anything he possibly could.  And then it got to the point where, yeah, it was OK.  I mean, I need to see a neurologist like because he just couldn't find anything that he could do that he himself could do anymore, that it had to be a neurologist that did it then."
So you got referred off to a neuro?,I did 
They probably would have gone the Botox route.,"Yes, I did Botox for several years.  In the meantime, though, I did have a cerebral Hemangioma rupture, so I had to have surgery to remove that.  And that was misdiagnosed by our local hospital as just another migraine.  So my doctor went that is not just another migraine.  And he was the one that discovered that I had a severe rupture and got me sent to see neurosurgeon.  And so, yeah, in between that and was my neurologist, that's when we had a lot more other things happening too."
"So your brains not happy, You've tried everything.  You've had one of the the complications that we have, unhappy brains have.",Two brain aneurysms.
Are you like collecting the set?,Yeah
"Stroke.  Imagine, Homer.  Yeah.  OK, we have to laugh about it, right?  It's a bit of dark humor.  Yeah.  Migraine brains are very unhappy brains, and they do kind of present more commonly, particularly with aneurysms and strokes.  So please do take it seriously.  If it doesn't feel like a normal attack, don't let a doctor tell you that it is just a migraine attack.  Yeah, get it checked out.  At least get an MRI if you live somewhere you do have MRI, which is not always the case.  ",
"So, all right, how did you go with Aimovig?","Aimovig was absolutely wonderful.  I started taking it in January 2019 and immediately, almost immediately, within a week and a half, the migraine stopped, stopped, stopped."
Like somebody turned off a switch.,"Absolutely.  And when they're thinking this, this is just got to be like, this can't be real."
What's going on?,"Yeah, this can't be right.  I've got, I've got to be getting another like what?  What on earth is happening?  And I think it was about four months later, I got my first migraine, which was all of three hours.  And I went, 'cause I'm there thinking, yeah, if one's gotta happen, it's gotta happen.  And when it actually when I was A and it was only a day or two before the injection was due.  And I'm going, OK, I'm about, I'm running out.  So that's obviously why I'm getting this little thing.  That's because I'm due to have my injection.  And I think in that whole 15 months I had, I did have one big migraine, which I ended up in hospital for, ended up in the Ed department for a whole 72 hours.  And I was counting, but it was a hemoplagic 1.  And so I, they were worried that I was having a stroke.  I mean, I knew it wasn't a stroke because I've had the stroke symptoms before.  It wasn't the same as when I did have it, but they were very concerned.  So they kept me in the emergency department for for 72 hours.  But other than that one, I think I had about maybe 3 breakthroughs on the day or the day before that I was meant to have the injection and they were only a couple of hours."
"Pretty mild, I think.  So I had a very similar kind of response, right?  Six days.  It was like somebody flipped a switch and I was suddenly back like, hi.  Yeah, it's, it's, it's really quite a phenomenal feeling.  It took me about six months to get to 0 migraine days.  And then I stayed there for a year until I stupidly went off.  I'm a big and we'll talk about that in a SEC.  But yeah, it's really quite phenomenal.  So the first month I still, I still had about 15 days, but that's down from 30, right?  So I was same as you all day, every day had been for eight years.  To suddenly go to nothing or close to nothing in a very like, you know, six weeks.  And suddenly I have more days that are migraine free than migraine days from all day, every day for eight years is really quite a phenomenal shift.  And one of the things I found, I don't know if you found the same thing, and certainly, you know, it's been a bit of chatter about it online, is that the anxiety actually goes up.  So almost everybody with migraine lives with anxiety right as part of the package deal.  But the migraine actually went up in anticipation of the next attack.  That was going to be massive.  It had to be massive because I've been so good for so long.  The next one's going to be bad.  It took me months, like a good six months to deal with that anxiety.  And that was working with a therapist, the whole thing, kind of allowing myself, giving myself permission to be well.  ",
How did you find that transition from completely debilitated to I'm good?,"Yeah, I kept waiting for like it was a case of when, when's it going to hit?  When when is this thing going to be?  Yeah, I kept expecting something bad to happen the whole time I'm expecting something bad.  And I mean, when I did have that bad one, I'm going, Yep, Yep, this makes sense.  It's going to be there.  But then it just took longer and longer.  I thought it was right.  It said that whole it's."
"The anticipation, the fear of the next attack is actually worse than the attack.  So you kind of come out of that phase and.  And you and I both had, you know, a good year of pretty good life, really.",Yes
What led to the decision to come off it?,"Pretty much we couldn't afford it.  I only work part time because I'm a part time teacher and I have this, at that point, I had a child at university who is solely funded because we earn that little bit too much from government, according to them, for them to be able to give him any money.  And yes, so and I've got another child that's at home who has a mental illness.  So we are looking, we look after him.  So yeah, we basically could not afford it.  So I had been transferred to something that was slightly more affordable so."
"So when you came off Aimovig, did you have a gap between coming off Aimovig and starting ingality?","I didn't I went back from one to the other.  I have ended up I've I've got a lot of complications with ingality.  I've ended up with severe food allergies, but I can put up with that if I can put up with not being able to have coffee, gluten, lactose."
"Maybe it does make life harder though, like.","I mean, I'm, I'm, it makes life, it makes life very hard, but I can, I can put up with it if it means that I can still have most days migraine free.  I don't know.  I don't have.  I still get migraines on it.  I've had three this month. That's so it's not nearly as good as a Aimovig, and I'll go back to a Aimovig in an absolute heartbeat if we could afford it. And if it if it was at the same price, yeah, that would be there would be no questions asked."
"Yeah, so I did basically the same thing, except that I took six weeks off, then tried to shut a mingality and mingality didn't work.  Like it just did nothing.  I was actually worse.  So I found coming off I'm a big that declined back to hell.  And you know, there's really no better word for it.  It's my grand.  Hell was really rapid, like it, you know, like there was a couple of days where I kind of felt good, and then like about two weeks after I'd missed the first shot, I just woke up with the most enormous hemiplegic full silk, can't walk, can't sit up, can't eat my, you know, can't eat, can't drink Hemi.  And it was just kind of hellish.  From there.  I tried Emgality and it like literally did nothing.  It was like I was taking a placebo.  If anything.  I got more irritable and more Moody and I put on some weight.  So I bit the bullet and went back to Aimovig and I've gone all the way back to the beginning.  So I've got, you know, like there's really rapid improvement, but it's like the first six months, it's not like the next year where I was completely free.  So it's like there's, you know, there's still a few breakthrough attacks.  I still feel a bit aura E, you know, like aura E.  There you go, there's a word.  Just make one up by the.",
,Way I know what you're meaning because that was premonitory.
"Yeah, premonitory symptoms are still there.  You know, they're, they're kind of feeling a bit weird, maybe occasionally feeling a bit euphoric, which I have a lot in the the prodrome, the, you know, the tingling of the aura or a visual aura and then it's disappearing, which is good.  And a couple of them are going through to a bit more of attack, but that's that's it, right?  That's a massive improvement from can't walk, can't sit up, can't feed myself.  Yeah.  And that's what I think people don't understand is that's the difference that we're talking about.  We're literally talking about the difference between being completely debilitated or not for the price of $264.00 a month the government doesn't want to pay.",Yeah.
"And that's what I don't understand, right, is that why would you keep somebody in such a state of disability, unable to work, dependent on welfare or dependent on loved ones, unable to function, unable to be productive taxpayers?  If it's such a small price, it's, you know, it's, it's such a small price to pay for those of us like me and most of you know, the board of Migrant Australia, you know, to be back in the world, you know, in, in your case, the, you know, the case of two of your children, it's, you know, it's the difference between being able to be a functioning member of society or being a burden on society.  And we shouldn't be made to feel the burden.  But more than that, we really shouldn't be made to feel like we aren't worth $264.00 a month.",Yeah.
"Because that's actually really putting a price tag on our lives, and to be told that we can't have the same access to effective medications and universal healthcare as everybody else because there's too many of us just drives me around the bend.  Anyway, let's go back to talking about the drugs from the politics, because I'll get too cranky.",
,"I was going to say, what was I found really interesting was when I was in hospital for those three days, one of the doctors and not for their doctors, one of the Med students who pretends that they're a doctor that was in the emergency department.  I had said that I was on Imivic and myself this time they look at me and they go, what?  She said, oh, I've had my sister's on that good.  And then when she said and what, where's your pain?  And I said, ah, it said about 5 to 6.  She said, oh, so an 8 to 9 for any normal person.  Yeah, I thought she knows."
She gets one of our people.,Yeah
,"So I thought that was really nice actually having someone that relates to someone that has migraine and knew exactly where we actually stood because when they when they say, well where's your pain level?  Our pain levels are something completely different to anyone else's pain levels."
"Yeah, yeah.  You know, like I always reserve 10 for, you know, passing out.  Yeah.  And it takes a lot for me to pass out.  Like I remember once saying I was at a level 8 pain and having a nurse looking at me going, well, you don't look like it.  And I'm like, well, I cry at 9 and I pass out at 10.  So am I crying?  And she said no.  And I said, right, so I'm an 8.  And that's, you know, that that was my grand life for me for a very long time.  And it's really quite cruel to have these drugs.  And I was joking with someone the other day that I think about everything now in terms of Aimovigs, right?  I need to get the car fixed, but that's one Aimovig.  And and I shouldn't be thinking that way.  I shouldn't be thinking that I have to, you know, value everything in my life by whether or not I can afford my medication.  This is Australia, it's not the United States.  It's not supposed to be like this.  ",
"But anyway, what advice, just to wrap this up, would you give to somebody who is either thinking about trying Aimovig or is on Aimovig and thinking about switching to Angality?","Love for me, the reason to go with the ingality was for start, my GP could prescribe it and I didn't have to keep going down to the neurologist, which for me is 3 to 4 days off work.  So I would say if, if you could remain on Amovic and you didn't have to worry about the taking days off work and things like that, absolutely stick to Amovic.  If money was not a worry, stick to a Mobic.  I, I hope that the government gets off their **** and just doesn't please, please understand we really need this.  It's like a Mobic.  I said if I if I could go, if I could afford to go back on it, I would."
"But there is a big difference between $263 a month and $695 a month.  It's hurts, yeah.  You know, if, if I could go to either in Gality or Ajovy with any confidence that, you know, I'd get anything out of them even, you know, as you say, with more side effects.  OK.  ",
I have no side effects on Aimovig at all.,"Yeah, no, not this guy.  Oh, a bit of dropping of hair.  But I had masses and masses of hair, so a little bit of dropping meant nothing."
"Mine actually is really funny, right?  Because I feel bad for the people that have lost hair because mine, I don't know if you can see, is crazy long.  I It's just, it just keeps growing, like growing and growing and growing.","Oh my, mine was crazy.  I've cut off stack.  Yeah, mine was crazy long as well.  And my husband kept saying I can actually make a carpet out of everything that you've dropped.  And I just went, I'll just cut it.  And I cut it to about here.  And it's, it's, I've cut so much.  I keep cutting so much off it, it's not funny.But I did lose a lot of hair.  But then again I said I'm in my 50s and you start losing here in anyway."
"Yeah, look, it is.  Is really, you know, it is really kind of tough to sit here and go here is this amazing drug it will fix your problem and you know, you won't have any issues and you know, most people, the vast majority of people don't get side effects.  There are I think it's about 3% that get the Constipation issues right, which is actually that's fairly significant, you know, and, and some people it was quite bad like they couldn't stay on Aimovig that happens.  But when you talk about taking, you know, a good 25% to, you know, somebody between 25 and 30% for each of the drugs being near curity breaks the kind of responses that you and I had super responses.  You know, it's like, why are we even debating whether or not these go on the PBS?  Why are we still debating it two years after these drugs became?",
"Like it's, it's just, you know, I can get very, very hated on this particular subject anyway, but thank you very much for joining me to talk about Amy Big today and happy Migraine Awareness Month.",Thank you for having me.
